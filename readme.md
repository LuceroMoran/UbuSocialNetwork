#Ubu Social Network

Computer programming has a lot of important aspects to it, from the software

aspects of hardware design to its community. It involves not only coding, but also a

social interaction within developers.

Over the last few years we have seen the rise of the open­source software modality

in development processes, which has led to the biggest technology innovation ever

overall. Examples of some open­source software products are Android, Mozilla

Firefox and Git, just to name a few. With this in mind we have created Ubu, which is

an open­source project that is focused to improve the way students learn, work and

interact with each other.
